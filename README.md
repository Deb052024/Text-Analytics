# Text-Analytics on Tweet Clasification
# NLP Project for Disaster Tweet Classification
 # Background
 In the digital era, social media platforms like Twitter are pivotal in disseminating real-time 
information, particularly during emergencies and disasters. However, distinguishing tweets that 
genuinely indicate disasters from unrelated ones poses a significant challenge, even for humans. 
Organizations such as disaster relief agencies and news outlets are keenly interested in developing 
automated methods to monitor Twitter for real-time disaster alerts.

# Challenge
The primary challenge is to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately classifying 
tweets as related to real disasters or not. The nuanced and context-dependent nature of tweets, 
where terms like “fire” or “flood” may be used metaphorically, adds complexity to the task. The 
model must reliably discern the true intent behind the language used. 

# Objectives 

# 1. Classification Model Development: Build a machine learning model to classify tweets as 
disaster-related or not. 

# 2. Accuracy and Precision: Ensure high accuracy and precision in predictions to minimize false 
alarms and optimize disaster response. 

# 3. Robustness: Design a model resilient to language variations such as slang, abbreviations, and 
cultural nuances. 

# 4. Scalability: Create a scalable system capable of processing large volumes of tweets in real
time.
